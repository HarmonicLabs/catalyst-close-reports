## List of challenge KPIs and how the project addressed them

The Mutexo project addresses key challenges in providing efficient, secure, and modular communication between Cardano-based applications.

The project aimed to meet the following KPIs:

1. **Security and reliability of communication**  
   - Implemented secure and robust communication protocols for Cardano-based apps.  
   - Focused on error handling and secure message exchanges to ensure reliability.  
   - Regularly audited codebase for vulnerabilities and potential exploits.

2. **Usability and modularity of the system**  
   - Developed two repositories, `mutexo-server` and `mutexo-client`, to facilitate modular integration.  
   - Enhanced documentation to ensure easy setup and use for developers.  
   - Ensured the libraries were flexible, allowing for integration with various types of projects.

## Key achievements (in particular around collaboration and engagement)

- Developed the `mutexo-server` and `mutexo-client` repositories, which provide modular and reusable code for building secure communication systems.
- Created detailed documentation to assist developers in implementing and using the system.

## Key learnings

- Modularity and flexibility in system design are critical to accommodating various use cases in the Cardano ecosystem.
- Clear, concise documentation is essential for developer adoption.

## Next steps for the product or service developed
