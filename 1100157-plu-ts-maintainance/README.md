## List of challenge KPIs and how the project addressed them

The Developer Ecosystem challenge in Project Catalyst focuses on
enhancing the developer experience to facilitate the creation of
successful applications on the Cardano platform.

The project aimed to ensure long-term usability and efficiency by
focusing on the following KPIs:

1. **Maintenance and stability of the library**  
   - Conducted testing and debugging to improve the tool's stability.  
   - Improved error handling to minimize unexpected failures.

2. **Performance improvements of the generated contracts**  
   - Optimized contract compilation to reduce execution time.  
   - Enhanced on-chain efficiency by minimizing redundant computations.  
   - Benchmarked and profiled contract execution to remove bottlenecks.  

## Key achievements (in particular around collaboration and engagement)

- Maintained an eDSL for TypeScript and JavaScript, making it easier
  for developers proficient in these languages to build on Cardano.
- Improved framework stability.

## Key learnings

- Aligning development tools with popular languages lowers the entry
  barrier for new developers.
- Continuous optimization and maintenance are crucial for usability
  and developer satisfaction.
- Active community engagement accelerates iterative improvements.

## Next steps for the product or service developed

- Un-embed the language from the framework to improve modularity and
  usability. ([project reference](https://milestones.projectcatalyst.io/projects/1300109))
- Continue refining contract compilation and optimizing execution.
- Expand the ecosystem of supported tools and integrations.

## Final thoughts/comments

- The HLabs: plu-ts project enriches the Cardano ecosystem by making
  it accessible to more developers.
- Ongoing development and community engagement are key to long-term
  success.
